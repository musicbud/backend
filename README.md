# MusicBud

<div align="center">
  <h1>MusicBud</h1>
  <p>A REST API that matches users with similar music tastes based on the Spotify API.</p>
  <p><em>üéµ Find your music buddies! üéµ</em></p>
  <p><strong>Status:</strong> In Progress</p>
</div>

## üìñ Overview

MusicBud is a platform that connects people based on their musical preferences. Using data from Spotify and other music services, our algorithm identifies potential "music buddies" by analyzing listening habits, favorite artists, genres, and tracks. The system uses a sophisticated matching algorithm implemented on a Neo4j graph database to find connections between users.

## üóÑÔ∏è Databases

MusicBud uses two databases for optimal performance and scalability:

- **Neo4j (Graph Database):**
  Used for storing all music-related data, user preferences, and relationships. Powers the AI recommendation and matching engine.
  Configured via the `NEOMODEL_NEO4J_BOLT_URL` setting in your environment or `musicbud/settings.py`.

- **Relational Database (Default: SQLite):**
  Used for user authentication, login info, and Django admin data.
  By default, this is SQLite, but you can use PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc. by updating the `DATABASES` setting in `musicbud/settings.py`.

**How they work together:**
- User login and authentication are handled by Django‚Äôs relational database.
- All music and social graph data are managed in Neo4j.
- The app links users across both databases using unique identifiers (UIDs).

### ü§ñ AI-Powered 'Get Common' Endpoints

These endpoints use AI and graph analysis to find items (artists, tracks, genres, etc.) that you and another user (bud) have in common. They require authentication and a `bud_id` in the request body.

**Base URL:** `/bud/common/`

| Endpoint                  | Description                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| liked/artists            | Common liked artists                        |
| liked/tracks             | Common liked tracks                         |
| liked/genres             | Common liked genres                         |
| liked/albums             | Common liked albums                         |
| played/tracks            | Common played tracks                        |
| top/artists              | Common top artists                          |
| top/tracks               | Common top tracks                           |
| top/genres               | Common top genres                           |
| top/anime                | Common top anime                            |
| top/manga                | Common top manga                            |

#### **Usage Example**

**Request:**
```http
POST /bud/common/liked/artists
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>

{
  "bud_id": "<bud_user_uid>"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "name": "Artist Name",
      "image": "https://...",
      // ...other artist fields
    },
    // ...more items
  ],
  "count": 10,
  "next": null,
  "previous": null
}
```

- Replace `liked/artists` with any of the endpoints above to get common tracks, genres, albums, etc.
- The `bud_id` is the unique identifier of the other user (bud) you want to compare with.
- The response is paginated and contains the common items and their details.

For more details and to test these endpoints, use the [Postman collection](./postman_collection/collection.json).
