# MusicBud

<div align="center">
  <h1>MusicBud</h1>
  <p>A REST API that matches users with similar music tastes based on the Spotify API.</p>
  <p><em>ðŸŽµ Find your music buddies! ðŸŽµ</em></p>
  <p><strong>Status:</strong> In Progress</p>
</div>

## ðŸ“– Overview

MusicBud is a platform that connects people based on their musical preferences. Using data from Spotify and other music services, our algorithm identifies potential "music buddies" by analyzing listening habits, favorite artists, genres, and tracks. The system uses a sophisticated matching algorithm implemented on a Neo4j graph database to find connections between users.

## ðŸ’» Development

### Setting up Development Environment
1. Follow the installation steps above
2. Set `DEBUG=True` in your `.env` file
3. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

### Database Migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Running the Development Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Code Style
This project follows PEP 8 style guidelines. You can check your code with:
```bash
flake8 .
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
python manage.py test
```

### Coverage Reports
```bash
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
```

## ðŸ“¤ Deployment

### Production Setup
1. Set `DEBUG=False` in your `.env` file
2. Configure a proper production database
3. Set appropriate `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
4. Use a production-ready web server (Gunicorn, uWSGI, etc.)

### Example with Gunicorn and Nginx
1. Install Gunicorn:
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   ```

2. Create a systemd service file
3. Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy
4. Set up SSL certificates

## ðŸ”’ Security Practices

- **Never commit** your `.env` file to version control
- Keep API keys and secrets secure
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use environment variables for all sensitive information
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies updated

### Recent Security Improvements
We've recently performed a comprehensive security audit and made the following improvements:

- Cleaned sensitive information from git history
- Implemented strict API key rotation policies
- Enhanced user authentication flow
- Added rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Updated all dependencies to address known vulnerabilities
